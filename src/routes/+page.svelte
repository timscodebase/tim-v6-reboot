			My brain works differently than most. Because of this, traditional education is not for me. I
			have taken a few college courses, but I have learned most of what I know through self-study
			and experimentation (reverse engineering others websites). I have a passion for learning and I
			am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay current in this rapidly changing
			landscape. The following are some of the most influential educators I have learned from along
			my journey:
